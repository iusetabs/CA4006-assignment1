# This is the repo for our project


+ ## This is the assignment link: https://www.computing.dcu.ie/~mcrane/CA4assignmentElevator.html


## Main points: 

+ ### Elevator controller in the 10 floor terminal building 

+ ### The elevator(s) can be represented using threads

	- ### Each person boarding or leaving the elevator is also represented by a thread

## Methods

+ ### ArrivingGoingFromTo(int atFloor, int toFloor)

	- ###  100 ticks to go from one floor to the adjacent one



## Point to keep in mind
#### Any form of creativity that you feel like putting in that will add interest to my marking of the project (variable weight trolleys, Nice GUIs, multiple elevators, 'smart' elevators with AI, random events such as faulty lifts etc) is encouraged and marks awarded for the project will reflect this.  Making use of java large-scale thread management support would be essential.
